Astronauts sleep in vertical sleeping bags, eat rehydrated meals, and exercise with specially designed resistance bands. The crew shares a space about the size of a large van, requiring meticulous organization and teamwork. Every activity from brushing teeth to using the toilet requires special procedures in microgravity. Despite the constraints, crew members report a sense of wonder looking at Earth through Orion's windows.",
